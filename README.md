This is the code for our J-BHI paper "Landmark localization for cephalometric analysis using multiscale image patch-based graph convolutional networks". Only coarse stage code is now publicly available. For more details, please refer


Our code is tested with Python 3.8, Tensorflow 2.5, CUDA 11.2 and cuDNN 8.1. Note that even slightly different environment from ours may lead to training/inference errors.
